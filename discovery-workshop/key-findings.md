# Key Findings â€“ Discovery Workshop

Based on the personas and empathy mapping exercise, several key themes emerged that will inform the redesign of the student portal:

---

##  Pain Points Identified

- The portal interface is cluttered and non-intuitive.
- Important actions like course registration are buried or confusing.
- System performance is poor, especially during peak times.
- Faculty tools are outdated and overly manual.
- Advisors lack real-time visibility into student progress.

---

##  User Needs

- A cleaner, more intuitive UI for core tasks (registration, grades, support).
- Faster load times and improved performance during critical dates.
- Better integration across systems to avoid duplication.
- Clear communication about deadlines and system status.

---

##  Opportunities for Improvement

- Introduce a dashboard with personalized shortcuts for students.
- Modernize the course registration experience with guided steps.
- Provide real-time grade and progress tracking.
- Streamline faculty and advisor workflows through role-based access.

These findings will shape the backlog and prioritization in the next phase of the project.
