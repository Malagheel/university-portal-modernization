# University Student Portal Modernization

## Background
The current student portal at XYZ University is outdated and difficult to use. Students often report frustration with tasks such as course registration, checking grades, and accessing support services. Faculty and staff also face challenges maintaining content and managing student interactions efficiently.

## Problem Statement
The portal fails to meet the expectations of modern students in terms of usability, accessibility, and responsiveness. It also lacks integration with other university systems, leading to duplicated data and manual work.

## Stakeholders
- **Students** – Primary users who need easy access to academic and support services.
- **Faculty** – Need efficient tools to manage class schedules, grades, and student communication.
- **Academic Advisors** – Require visibility into student progress to provide guidance.
- **IT Department** – Responsible for system maintenance and security.
- **University Administration** – Oversees compliance, budgeting, and performance metrics.

## Project Goals
- Improve the user experience of the student portal with a student-centered design.
- Streamline course registration, grade tracking, and support requests.
- Ensure integration with existing backend systems (e.g., SIS, LMS).
- Increase self-service capabilities to reduce administrative burden.

## Scope
- Discovery phase to understand current pain points and needs.
- Redesign of 3 key features: course registration, grade tracking, and support access.
- Agile delivery in iterative sprints with stakeholder feedback loops.
- Minimal viable product (MVP) planned for end of semester pilot.
