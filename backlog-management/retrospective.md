# Sprint 1 Retrospective â€“ Student Portal Modernization

##  What Went Well
- Course registration workflow was well-scoped and achievable in one sprint
- Collaboration with the design team helped deliver a user-friendly UI mockup
- Validation logic passed early QA testing with minimal bugs

##  What Could Be Improved
- Initial user testing recruitment took longer than expected
- Developer time was underestimated for integration tasks
- Missed early input from accessibility specialist

##  Action Items
- Start recruiting user testers 1 week before sprint start
- Add buffer time for back-end integration in sprint estimates
- Include accessibility checks in the Definition of Done

Reflecting on this sprint helped the team better understand delivery risks and plan more effectively for Sprint 2.
